 # Background
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

## The Challenge
Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 1 and April 30 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.

You are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook.

As the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).

We have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.

## Companies and Organizations
There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.

I have worked on with two files
1. In this [Notebook](https://github.com/girish208/Machine_Learning-Projects/blob/master/Covid-19/covid-19-eda-and-deep-analysis-using-visualization.ipynb) EDA on dataset and trying to find current underlying patterns of viral spread across countries and using Ensemble methods to do regression. Some of the features of this dataset are Interactive and hence recommended to use [NB viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
2. In this [Notebook](https://github.com/girish208/Machine_Learning-Projects/blob/master/Covid-19/time-series-model.ipynb) I have tried to use Time Series Analysis tools such as Holt, Exponential Smoothening and ARIMA to do forecasting. This file also has some interactive features and recommended to use [NB viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)

3. **Covid-19 Dashboard**: This [Notebook](https://github.com/girish208/Machine_Learning-Projects/blob/master/Covid-19/covid19.ipynb) I have built a real time dashboard to keep a tap on Covid-19 Cases. Please use NBviewer to view it.
